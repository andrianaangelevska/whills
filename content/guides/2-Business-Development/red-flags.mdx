## The Bad Client

We can't overstate this: the overwhelming majority of customers are an absolute pleasure to deal with. They are the lifeblood of Novvum, and the reason that weâ€™re afforded the opportunity to do what we do every single day.

### Here are some traits to watch for.

If more than 2 of these traits are present, discuss with Raj, Rohit or Trevor on whether to move forward.

- No experience building software
- Lack of domain knowledge about the business being started
- Unclear needs and wants (changing requirements at every meeting or call)
- Self-funded or funded by parents/family
- Budget under 30k (Not applicable to audits, or existing product work)
- Unreasonable timelines (less than 1 month timeline for applications)
- Unwilling to pay for design or discovery (unless proper documentation has been created)
