title: "Nonnegotiable"
---

This guide describes Novvum's nonnegotiable standards for prospective and existing client engagements.

> If you have any problems or requests, please contact Raj or Rohit (via [Slack](https://novvum.slack.com)).

---

**Novvum will not accept any form of [equity](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/equity.asp) as a payment of service from any potential and/or existing client.**

- We can offer payment plans with additional interest (minimum 8%) – basically a loan – for existing clients that are short on cash.

All delivery-based projects **must recieve a deposit prior to beginning service.**

- Projects with a total contract value of less than \$10,000.00 will require 100% of the contract's value as a deposit (from the client) prior to beginning service.

### Late & Overdue Payments

> Our intent here is to put forth our best work on a project, not to have the client feel we are some sort of collections company. These are guidelines set to deal with the worse case scenarios (when it comes to late payments)

**Levels of the Late Clients**

| Level         |                       Past Due Period | Actions Taken                                                                                                                                                          |
| :------------ | ------------------------------------: | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forgetful     |                   1 to 3 days pastdue | Nothing                                                                                                                                                                |
| Irresponsible |                   3 to 7 days pastdue | Friendly reminder email with Invoice                                                                                                                                   |
| Heedless      |   7 to 14 days pastdue (1 to 2 Weeks) | Email Pastdue Invoice, direct email from account manager to point of contact                                                                                           |
| Negligent     |  14 to 30 days pastdue (2 to 4 weeks) | Email Pastdue Invoice, a request for a meeting with project & account managers, and a warning for stoppage of service                                                  |
| Wanker        | 30 to 90 days pastdue (1 to 3 months) | Email sent to client informing them that service has been discontinued, deliverables are withheld, and warning that collections letter will be sent by general counsel |
| Delinquent    |                     > 90 days pastdue | Remaining balance is sent to collection and Novvum will not reingage with the project                                                                                  |  |

**Deliquent** level clients with pastdue invoices exceeding **60 days** will prompt Novvum to discontinue services and withhold all deliverables.

- Novvum will resume services after recieving payment.
- The clients billing status (i.e _Net 30_, _Net 90_, etc) will be **demoted** to a **_Due on Reciept_** (or _Net 0_) status following the late or missed payment
- **Novvum will charge an additional interest fee on top of the overdue amount** (15% minimum) for every week payment is not recieved.

> To clarify, these are the specific technologies we would have to use on the project. Not work with. We are more than happy to work with these [legacy systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system), and convert them to a more desirable [stack](https://mixpanel.com/topics/what-is-a-technology-stack/)

Novvum will not service any projects that require to be written in the following **programming languages**:

- PHP
- ASP (.NET)
- BASIC
- **Objective C** – Outside of [iOS development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS)
- CoffeScript
- Perl
- Lua

> The following we'd be willing to work with, but it's not recommended – basically, the client will have to pay some big bucks to persuade us –.

Projects we would be **averse** to working on

- A [legacy project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legacy_system) without any documentation nor access to the original development team
- A project with a strict scopes set by a non-technical individual
- A project that claims to be the next Twitter (or Facebook, or MySpace, or Uber) with no detailed description of services

---

> The following points demonstrate what will not be tolerated from a client, employee, or stakeholder at Novvum

- Projects that produces a conflict of interest with an existing project
- Projects that display an exuberance of racist, sexist and/or obsene opinions
- Projects that require any form of service that is outside [US Federal Laws](https://www.usa.gov/laws-and-regs)
- Clients with history of [obsene criminal offenses](https://dictionary.law.com/Default.aspx?selected=1368)
- Clients with history of [financial criminal offenses](https://criminal.findlaw.com/criminal-charges/fraud-financial-crimes.html)
- Clients who are in trial for a [felony](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal-defense/felony-offense/felony-classes-charges-penalties)
