The Novvum integrations team – pending name Cable – is assembling an inclusive Docs section. The section will include pertinant articles written to be easily understood by all current and future members of Novvum.

Cable plans to write and maintain these Docs on [Novvum's Github](https://github.com/Novvum/novvum).

## Welcome!

You don't have to be an expert on a topic to write about it – this entire company is one coordinated effort to learn, so even if you make a mistake, another teammate will help you correct it before the [pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) gets merged.

If you’d like to help by writing an article, find a stub article in the Novvum Bulletin section, write the article, then
[open a pull request (PR)](/contributing/how-to-contribute/#contributing-to-the-documentation) in the [Novvum GitHub repo](https://github.com/Novvum/novvum) to replace the stub with your article.

If you can't find a stub about the topic you'd like to write about, you can open a PR in GitHub that creates the stub and includes your draft article. Feel free to ask questions in the PR comments if you're not sure where to put a new article in the directory structure.

Before you begin writing, make sure to read the rest of this style guide.

## What kinds of docs can I write?

> The term **Docs** refers to both _documentation_ and _blog content_

Docs can cover a broad range of topics. Please see the following
examples:

- [guides](/docs/add-404-page/)
- [guide overviews](/docs/styling/)
- [tutorials](/tutorial/part-one/)
- [plugin README](/packages/gatsby-source-filesystem/)
- [starter README](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default)

Please see the [Docs templates](/contributing/docs-templates/) for guidelines on how to format the above kinds of documents.

## Writing process

### Think of your audience

Before you begin writing, answer these questions. Sample answers have been included:

Question: Who will read my writing?
_Answer: Developers with knowledge and experience coding in HTML, CSS, and JS but not necessarily React or GraphQL._

Question: What do I hope my readers will know and/or be able to do after reading it?
_Answer (example): I hope my readers will be able to successfully implement authentication to their GraphQL api._

Once you answer those questions, create an outline of the topic and think about any coding examples you'll use (if applicable). This helps to organize your thoughts and make the writing process easier.

### Research

Many times, the information that needs to go in your document already exists somewhere.

Avoid copying and pasting huge chunks of other people's work – _ignore the fact that this style guide is awfully influenced by [Gatsby's Style Guide](https://gatsbyjs.org/contributing/gatsby-style-guide/)_ –. Instead, use their work to learn so you can write your own document. If you do quote someone's work verbatim, reference where you got the information.

If the content referenced is within the realm of Novvum, feel free to copy and paste without quoting or referencing.

Possible sources of great research materials:

- blog posts (on [hackernoon](https://hackernoon.com/), [hasura](https://hasura.io), [prisma](https://prisma.io/blog), [dzone](https://dzone.com/), [stackexchange](https://stackexchange.com/), [zdnet](https://www.zdnet.com/), [redmonk](https://redmonk.com/), and [sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/))
- docs (on [beautiful-docs](https://github.com/PharkMillups/beautiful-docs))
- video tutorials
- Discord, Spectrum, or Twitter conversations
- search engine results
- presentations you or others have given
- textbooks ([O'Reilly Media](https://www.oreilly.com/) preferred)
- dreams
- anything else you can think of

### Write drafts and get feedback

Technical writing (or any literature concerning science and technology for that matter), can be difficult
because it requires you to take a technical (usually abstract) topic and explain
it in a clear and concise manner.

You'll likely go through several
rounds of proofreading and editing before you're happy with your writing.

Also, there's a whole team of editors and proofreaders ready to support you.

Bounce ideas off of them and ask for input on your writing in the
[Slack](https://novvum.slack.com/marketing) and in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Novvum/novvum).

## Word choice

### Use "you" as the pronoun

Your articles should use the second person ("you") to help provide a conversational tone. This way, text and instructions seem to speak directly to the person reading it. Avoid using the first person ("I", "we", "let's", and "us").

Using "you" is more accurate than saying "we,". Typically, one person is reading the tutorial, guide, or documentation at a time and the you, as in the author of the tutorial, is not actually going through it with them. So "we" would be inaccurate.

You might notice that some technical documentation uses third person pronouns and nouns like "they" and "the user," which add more distance and feel colder than the conversational and warm "you" and "your."

### Avoid "easy" and "simple"

Avoid using words like "easy", "simple," and "basic". If readers have a hard time following your Docs that is supposedly "easy," they tend to question their abilities.

Consider using more specific descriptors; for example, when you say the phrase "deployment is easy," **what do you really mean**? Is it easy because it takes fewer steps than another option? If so, just use the most specific descriptor possible, which in that case would be "this deployment method involves fewer steps than other options."

### Avoid emojis, slang, and metaphors

Avoid using emojis, emoticons, idiomatic expressions / slang, or metaphors when writing technical documentation, critiques, and guides. Novvum is actively participating in a global open source community, and
the cultural meaning of an emoji, emoticon, or some "Cali" slang may be different around the world. Use your best judgment!
Also, emojis can render differently on different systems.

### Define or reference jargon

Articles should be written with short, clear sentences, and use as little jargon
as necessary.

> Jargon: (n.) special words or expressions that are used by a particular profession or group and are difficult for others to understand: legal jargon.

All jargon should be defined immediately in plain English. In
other words, pretend like your readers have basic coding experience but not necessarily experience with concepts like GraphQL and the JAMstack (see what happened there? I just used two jargon words that need to be defined); you
need to define words that newcomers (or non-technical) readers might have a hard time understanding.

## Writing style

### Write concisely

Concise writing communicates the **bare minimum without redundancy**. Strive to make your writing **as short as possible**; this practice will often lead to more accurate and specific writing.

### Use clear hyperlinks

Hyperlinks should contain the **clearest words** to indicate where the link will lead you. [The use of the title attribute on hyperlinks should be avoided for accessibility reasons](https://developer.paciellogroup.com/blog/2012/01/html5-accessibility-chops-title-attribute-use-and-abuse/).

```markdown
<!-- Good -->

[Gatsby's docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/)

<!-- Bad -->

[here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/ "Gatsby's docs")
```

In tutorials that are meant for beginners, use as **few hyperlinks** as possible to **minimize distractions**. In docs, it's ok to include as many hyperlinks as necessary to provide relevant and interesting information and resources.

### Indicate when something is optional

When a paragraph or sentence offers an optional path, the beginning of the first sentence **should indicate that it's optional**.

For example:

"if you'd like to learn more about xyz, see our reference guide"

is clearer than

"Go to the reference guide if you'd like to learn more about xyz."

This method allows people who would _not_ like to learn more about xyz to stop reading the sentence as early as possible. This method also allows people who _would_ like to learn more about xyz to recognize the opportunity to learn quicker instead of accidentally skipping over the paragraph.

### Abbreviate terms

If you want to abbreviate a term in your article, write it out fully first, then
put the abbreviation in parentheses.

After that, you may use the abbreviation going for the rest of the article.

For example:

"In computer science, an
**abstract syntax tree (AST)** is ..."

### Use SEO optimized titles

> SEO stands for search engine optimized

This explains how to create a doc that shows up in search engines like Google or Bing.

When you create the new guide or tutorial under `/whills/`, you’ll either create a file or a folder should there be images associated with the doc.

File:

- `querying-data-with-graphql.md`

or

Folder:

- `querying-data-with-graphql`
- `querying-data-with-graphql/index.md`
- `querying-data-with-graphql/graphql-image.png`

The `.mdx` or `.md` title (or directory name) gets turned into the URL route automatically.

Article titles **should be short** and reflect the main theme of the article to help readers quickly find relevant info.

Many people use a search engine to find topics like "react graphql", so the article title should ideally reflect common search terms.

Here are some title examples:

- Creating & Modifying Pages
- Adding a 404 Page
- Querying Data with GraphQL

The folder name is used in the URL, so only use **dashes (-)**, **numbers (0-9)**, and
**lowercase letters (a-z)** for it.

Here are some folder name examples:

- creating-and-modifying-pages
- adding-a-404-page
- querying-data-with-graphql

> Note: Just to clarify, you can include special characters in the article title
> but _not_ in the `.md` file name or folder name (e.g. title: What is GraphQL? and Folder Name:
> what-is-graphql).

## Grammar and formatting

### Format titles and headers

Use [title case](https://www.grammar-monster.com/lessons/capital_letters_title_case.htm) for article titles (each major word is uppercase) and [sentence case](https://www.thoughtco.com/sentence-case-titles-1691944) for article headings (only the initial word is uppercase). Neither needs punctuation at the end of the phrase unless a question mark is required. Article titles do not take the series comma (also known as the Oxford comma) and use the ampersand (&) in place of “and.” Article headings do take the Oxford comma and use the word “and.”

Titles are automatically formatted as `h1`. Mark up article headings as `h2` and subheads as `h3` or `h4` as needed. Most article headings are conceptually and rhetorically at the same level as each other; avoid unnecessary complexity and mark them up as `h2` unless they’re true subheads.

Article title or document name:

> Salty, Sweet & Spicy

Article header or subhead:

> Salty, sweet, and spicy

### Format code blocks, inline code, and images

Use the following as reference when creating and editing docs:

- [formatting inline code and code blocks](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#code)
- [adding images to articles](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#images).
  If the images aren’t already hosted somewhere else on the web, you’ll need to put them online yourself.
  A good way to do this is to commit them to a GitHub repository of your own, then push them to GitHub.
  Then you can right click the image and copy its image source. And don't forget image alt text for accessibility!
  For help with crafting efficient screen reader text, refer to the [W3C's alt decision tree](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/).
- [header formatting](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers). Avoid using H1 header; that is reserved for the title of each document.

#### Code formatting: Type tab

Each code snippet will include a tab showing the language type the snippet contains. For example, the following YAML snippet will show a "YAML" tab...

````
```yaml
- id: Rohit Ravikoti
  bio: Secretly thinks Raj is the coolest
  twitter: @rovvum
```
````

...like so:

```yaml
- id: Rohit Ravikoti
  bio: Secretly thinks Raj is the coolest
  twitter: @rovvum
```

Please use the following language keywords where appropriate:

- `javascript` or `js`
- `jsx`
- `graphql`
- `html`
- `css`
- `shell`
- `yaml`
- `markdown`
- `diff`
- `flow`
- `graphql`
- find the [full supported languages reference here](https://github.com/rajinwonderland/react-code-blocks/wiki/Available-Languages-Reference)

If a language keyword is omitted, the type will show as `plaintext` (as shown above).

#### Code formatting: Titles

Where appropriate, add code titles to your code blocks. Switching between multiple files in the course of the document can confuse some readers. It's best to explicitly tell them where the code example should go. You can use syntax highlighting as usual, then add `title=your-path-name` to it. Use it like so:

````
```javascript title=src/util/alert.js
const s = "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good.";
alert(s);
```
````

Which will then look like:

```javascript title=src_util_alert.js
const s = "I solemnly swear that I'm up to no good."
alert(s)
```

#### Code formatting: Line highlighting

You may also choose to include line highlighting in your code snippets, using the following keywords inline in the snippet:

##### `highlight-line`: highlights the current line (WIP)

````
```javascript title=theme.js
exports default {
	colors: {
		black: `#000`, // highlight-line
		red: `#cc0000`,
	},
}
```
````

```javascript title=theme.js
exports default {
	colors: {
		black: `#000`, // highlight-line
		red: `#cc0000`,
	},
}
```

##### `highlight-next-line`: highlights the next line (WIP)

````
```javascript title=theme.js
exports default {
	colors: {
		black: `#000`,
    // highlight-next-line
		red: `#cc0000`,
	},
}
```
````

```javascript title=theme.js
exports default {
	colors: {
		black: `#000`,
    // highlight-next-line
		red: `#cc0000`,
	},
}
```

##### `highlight-start` & `highlight-end`: highlights a range (WIP)

````
```javascript title=theme.js
exports default {
	// highlight-start
	colors: {
      black: `#000`,
      red: `#cc0000`,
	},
	// highlight-end
}
```
````

```javascript title=theme.js
exports default {
	// highlight-start
	colors: {
      black: `#000`,
      red: `#cc0000`,
	},
	// highlight-end
}
```

### Capitalize proper nouns

Proper nouns should use correct capitalization when possible. Below is a list of words as they should appear in Guide articles.

- JavaScript (capital letters in "J" and "S" and no abbreviations)
- Node.js

A _full-stack_ developer (adjective form with a dash) works on the _full stack_
(noun form with no dash). The same goes with many other compound terms.

Use _frontend_ for both adjective and noun forms as it's [more common and easier to maintain](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/34447/is-it-front-end-frontend-or-front-end). For example,
a frontend developer works on the frontend. The same goes for _backend_.

_End users_ are spelled out with two words, rather than hyphenating with a dash.

### Use active voice

Use active voice instead of passive voice. Generally, it's a more concise and
straightforward way to communicate a subject. For example:

- (passive) The for loop in JavaScript is used by programmers to...
- (active) Programmers use the for loop in JavaScript to...

### Make lists clear with the Serial Comma (AKA the Oxford Comma)

Use the [Serial Comma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_comma), except in titles. It is a comma used after the penultimate
item in a list of three or more items, before ‘and’ or ‘or’ e.g. an Italian
painter, sculptor, and architect. It makes things clearer.

<p align="center">
  <img
    src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/017/771/the-oxford-comma_52c855ed979ed_w1500.jpg"
    style="width:75%px;margin:auto;max-width:400px"
  />
  <br />
  Confusion can happen when you don't use the Oxford comma
</p>

### Prefer US English

For words that have multiple spellings, prefer the US English word over British or Canadian English. For example:

- `color` over `colour`
- `behavior` over `behaviour`

### Use apps that help you edit

Use the [Hemingway App](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/). There’s nothing magical
about this tool, but it will automatically detect widely agreed-upon
style issues:

- passive voice
- unnecessary adverbs
- words that have more common equivalents

The Hemingway App will assign a “grade level” for your writing. You should aim
for a grade level of 6. Another tool available is the De-Jargonizer, originally
designed for scientific communication but might help avoid overspecialized
wording.

## Best practices

### Support software versions

When Novvum commits to supporting specific versions of software (e.g. Node 8 and up), this is reflected in documentation. Novvum documentation should be backwards compatible. This means we won't introduce any commands or practices that can't be used on previous versions. In rare circumstances, we'll consider mentioning a newly introduced command or practice as side notes. However, breaking changes (or changes that does not support previous versions of software) should be announced to users.


### Share best practices whenever possible

When there are multiple ways to complete a task, the docs should explain the following:

1. The most fundamental way of completing the task
2. The most common way of completing a task
3. The best way to complete the task on the lowest supported versions of software
4. The best practice and why is it the best (if different than 3)
5. Any tips on how to pick an option

For example, `gatsby-image` is a component that includes Novvum-Gatsby best practices for handling images, yet there are more fundamental and common ways of handling them. Documentation ought to make the best practice clear in addition to the most common and fundamental ways.

## The difference between tutorials and docs

The tutorials in `/tutorials/` are optimized for users/developers who are not experts in React, GraphQL and/or JavaScript, and therefore has a different purpose, tone, and style than the docs. The docs at `/docs/` are optimized for those with intermediate to expert mastery with React, GraphQL, and JavaScript – or whatever other topics we might have –

## Tutorial

### Tutorial audience

Through research, it's clear that developers of all skill levels read the tutorial and go back to reference it later.

The tutorial should prioritize helping users with the following attributes and goals.

Attributes:

- new to React and interested in it
- new to GraphQL and interested in it
- new to Gatsby and interested in it
- new to JavaScript ecosystem and interested in it
- proficient with browsers and operating system basics
- proficient with web servers

Looking for:

- a way to learn and/or improve React skills
- a way to learn and/or improve GraphQL skills
- a way to start a site and/or app project that uses React
- a way to start a site and/or app project that uses GraphQL

### Tutorial purpose

By following the steps in the tutorial, a user should:

- Experience the value of Novvum as quickly as possible. With Novvum, a reader typically values that it takes fewer steps (and is therefore easier) to:
  - start coding immediately without being an expert
  - start a new project
  - make edits and see them thru hot reloading
  - publish a site/server
  - do basic tasks like create pages, add resolvers, link between pages, create routing, change styles
- Know how to and actually start and deploy a site/server as quickly as possible.
- Be able to share their site/server.
- Know how to and actually find more advanced tutorials and docs.
- Use enough React to do basic tasks like creating pages, links, styles.
- Use enough GraphQL to do basic tasks like creating resolvers, linking a database, querying via [graphql-playground](https://github.com/prisma/graphql-playground).
- Have fun!

### Tutorial tone and style

The tone and style of the tutorial should effectively help the audience reach their goals.

### Use personal "you" and be warm

The main tutorial ought to use the same personal “you” like the rest of the docs; in addition, the tutorial ought to use a warm, validating tone by congratulating users, complimenting them, and generally saying things like “yay!” more often.

> Why not use "yay" in the docs as well? Since the tutorial's goal is to help users complete a series of steps, it is possible and helpful to congratulate them on successfully completing each step. Guides in the docs act as reference guides that users can browse at will rather than read from top to bottom. It doesn't make sense to congratulate someone on finishing a guide, since it's not a series of steps.

### Don't make users think more than is necessary

Because the audience of the tutorial is people who do not consider themselves experts, it's important to reduce the amount of new information to bare minimum. The goal: give people only the information necessary to complete a task and to know how to repeat the task again, outside of the context of the tutorial.

In practice, you can reach this goal by two rules of thumb:

- Reduce the number of hyperlinks, tabs, and environments to the least number required to complete the tasks in the tutorial.
- When there are multiple ways to complete a task, give people only one way. This way ought to be the best practice possible within the constraints of the lowest supported versions of software. If the best practice isn't possible with the lowest supported versions of software, mention that as a side note.

## Docs

### Docs audience

Developers of all skill levels read the docs and find them useful.

The docs should focus on helping users with the following attributes and goals.

Attributes:

- intermediate to advanced at GraphQL, React, and the general subject material
- frontend developer
- backend developer
- full stack developer
- prefer using a search engine and/or `command + f` (or `ctrl + f + do the hookey pokey` for pc users) to find things on sites

Looking for:

- way to get a site up and running quickly
- a quick way to get the right words, types, defaults, descriptions, parameters, and returns for the API
- bits of source code to study and/or copy
- step-by-step tutorials for advanced tasks
- understanding how the subject material works at a deep level, so deep that they could actually modify or customize their own projects, or contribute to Novvum oss
- how does Gatsby really work with Redux, React, and GraphQL?
- error messages that tell them if it’s a known bug/issue, lead them to docs, and/or suggest fixes
- guides for how things work in Hasura
- they usually already have strong opinions or requirements about what they want to use as their CMS or data source and want to know best practices for their workflow
- signs that Prisma is a reliable, long-term choice (signs that it is growing and improving and evidence it will be around for a long time)
- ways to check their project’s requirements against what React Native offers
- open source code from well-built example sites

### Docs purpose

By referencing the docs, a Novvum developer should:

- get tasks done as quickly as possible
- evaluate options for getting tasks done as quickly as possible
- build sites and apps as quickly as possible, including the following kinds of sites:
  - marketing
  - blogs
  - portfolio
  - e-commerce
  - authenticated

### Docs tone and style

The tone and style of the docs should effectively help the audience reach their goals.

### Use personal "you"

The docs use the personal “you” to address the user.

### Give experts as much relevant info to get the task done as quickly as possible

Because the audience of the docs is people who have intermediate to expert level of mastery with React & GraphQL, it's important to provide the information needed to complete tasks in addition to all relevant and helpful context, references, and alternatives. The goal: give people the information necessary to get tasks done as quickly and effectively as possible.

In practice, you can reach this goal by two general rules:

- Include an "additional information" section at the bottom of each guide with hyperlinks to relevant external blogposts, tutorials, and other Gatsby resources and docs.
- When there are multiple ways to complete a task, [follow these instructions](#share-best-practices-whenever-possible).

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

Here is how we measure the quality of the tutorial and docs. We will use ([cohort analysis](https://www.geckoboard.com/learn/kpi-examples/mobile-app-kpis/retention-rate/) to track improvements or regressions to the tutorial and docs.

## Why we chose GitHub for writing and maintaining docs

The way the Cable team maintains docs and tutorials must meet the following requirements:

- ability to ship quickly
- ability to iterate quickly
- OSS contributor access
- code editing functionality
- version control
- a way to get feedback on each doc

GitHub meets these requirements.
