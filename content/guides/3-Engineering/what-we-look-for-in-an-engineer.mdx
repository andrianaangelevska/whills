title: "What We Look For In An Engineer"
---

When Raj and I started the Novvum, we had very little
experience with mobile and web development.
However, our first real project was to build a
web app for motorcycle rentals within two months. To say
the least, it was extremely open-ended and we needed to
figure out what tools to use for storing the data,
building the frontend, and hosting the infrastructure.
Despite our lack of experience, we were able to
deliver the product on time.

There were a few factors that went in to making this possible:

1.  We weren't afraid to take on a new challenge we knew very little about.
1.  We became very good at resource-gathering and figuring out how to select
    various tools for the job and making them work together.
1.  We fell in love with the problem and did whatever it took figure it out.
    This meant poring through documentation and tutorials of various tools to
    see how they could be useful to the project. See our method for evaluating
    tools [here](https://medium.com/novvum/successfully-working-with-open-source-software-8698eb7a909f)

These are the qualities we look for in our engineers as well. We
want to build a team of people who use their resourcefulness to
**Figure Things Out**. This is why, when we assign tasks, we give
very little guidance on how the tools work-- we want the engineers
to figure it out for themselves. The guides available on the
internet do a much better job explaining the tools than we can.

> Today, we may give you tasks that we already know how to do, but tomorrow we
> may rely on you to do something we have no idea how to.

This is why we will use these early opportunities to
foster a culture of figuring things out and getting the job done well.
