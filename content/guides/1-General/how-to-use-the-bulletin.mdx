title: "How To Use The Bulletin"
---

The bulletin is where we go to find out two things:

- How busy anyone on the team is.
- To request and provide help on tasks.

You can find the bulletin [here](https://app.asana.com/0/1124901452821240/list)

## Team Members Section

The team members section is a list of all of the team members with two fields
associated with each person:

- **Utilization:** How much of their time is allocated this _week_ for projects and work
  on a scale of 1 (10% of time) to 10 (100% of time).
- **Today's Availability:** How much availability a person has for _today_ on a scale from
  high (very available) to low (very busy).

Seeing the above combination can help inform you on how much help to ask from someone.
For example, if a person has a high availability today, but a high utilization for this week,
you might only want to ask them to do small tasks that can be completed within the day.

## Tasks Section

The tasks area is broken down into sub-sections for each team. This is where teams can go
to post tasks they need help with. The type of tasks posted here are intended to be on the
board for a short period of time-- only until someone takes it up. The intention here is not
to track the progress of a task-- it is just to ask for help. Once someone is assigned to the
task, it can be moved to the individual team's projects to be tracked.
