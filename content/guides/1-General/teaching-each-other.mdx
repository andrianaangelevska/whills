This is a general guideline on what approach we should take when teaching
something new to each other. The main idea to keep in mind is that we want to
**<Link to="/general/figure-things-out">#FigureThingsOut</Link>**
and **<Link to="/general/what-to-document">document</Link>** our processes as
clearly as possible.

To create this kind of culture, we can approach how we teach each other in unique way. ‚ú®

## Learn together üî≠

To build our exploration muscles, it is important to use every opportunity to learn.
If you know how something works, then setup a little sandbox for the other person to play
in and explore the tool. If they don't understand something, research how it works together
even if you already know the answer.

Who knows? Maybe you'll learn something new yourself. The other person might ask simple
questions you didn't think of when you were first learning. This is the beauty of approaching
teaching as a way of learning together.

## Have them follow the documentation üìì

If what you are teaching them is something you created, see if they can
\#FigureThingsOut by looking at the README/documentation or code first. Oh, there's no
documentation? This is a good chance to start writing one üòÅ.

NOTE: It is very important that we use the documentation as the source of reference when
teaching each other. If we get the docs down right, then people should be able to
look at them in the future and be able to figure it out without your assistance.

If it is still not clear, then we need to look at where they are stuck.

### 1. They don't know the tool(s) that are being used

In this case, encourage them to do a google search and learn more about the tool(s).
Perhaps you could include helpful links in the README to get them started.
Although it's okay to explain what the tool does, it is very important not to just
tell them how the tool works. We want people to be actively seeking and not just being
fed information.

### 2. They do not understand how to get started

In this case, the documentation needs to be improved. Find out what is blocking them
and how to overcome it and then include it in the documentation.
