title: "Guide to GraphQL Weekly"
---

## Overview

[GraphQL Weekly](https://www.graphqlweekly.com/) (GQLW) is a weekly newsletter, owned by [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/), that curates GraphQL related resources. Novvum's role is to search for content, write informative summaries, and deploy our work to GraphQL Weekly's official website.

This is a great platform to push Novvum's content to Prisma's audience as well!
All content and summaries must be submitted by **Thursday** afternoon, so Prisma can send out their newsletter via email by **Friday** morning.

## Resources

_Tools for efficiency_

1. [http://debug.iframely.com/](http://debug.iframely.com/) - Great way to check if a summary already exists
2. [Summarybot](https://www.summarizebot.com/) on Novvum's Slack - Helps summarize lengthy articles quickly

_Relevance_ <br/>
Before writing any summaries, it helps to check with another person to make sure the resource is relevant or current.
It's best to look for resources that are posted within the current week. Sometimes 2 weeks is acceptable depending on how important the [information](https://www.notion.so/GQLW-Article-Curation-291a6921e2f544759b458f9cd777699b#68191064a9274f75aaa10f4cbc4378ba) is.

_Format_ <br/>
Typically, the first sentence mentions what type of link it is, whether it's an article, video, tutorial, etc.

<details><summary>First sentence examples</summary>

- "A detailed talk, by Robert Zhu..."

- "This interesting article discusses..."

</details>

<br />

Announcements introduce a new package or service.

<details><summary>Announcement examples</summary>

- "Introducing GraphiQL Explorer 2.0!"

- "GraphQL Codegen 1.0 is here!"

</details>

<br />
Each summary is around 2-3 sentences that include a couple of critical points as to why the article is interesting.

If you run out of ways to summarize the resource, mention any demo links, sample [code sandboxes](https://codesandbox.io/), or anything readers may find valuable.

<details><summary>Full summary examples</summary>

- "Check out Hasura‚Äôs 2 hour GraphQL Tutorial series on what GraphQL is and how to integrate GraphQL APIs with different web/mobile frameworks. They currently have tutorials using React, Vue, iOS, Hasura, and many more coming soon. The tutorials take you step by step from setting up a GraphQL client with Apollo to creating subscriptions and receiving realtime data."

- "Stay tuned for the release of [Honeypot.io](http://honeypot.io/)‚Äôs ‚ÄúGraphQL: The Documentary‚Äù on June 24th! Explore the story of why and how GraphQL came to be and the impact it‚Äôs having on big tech companies worldwide with Lee Byron, Nick Schrock, Dan Schafer, and many more."

- "DinoQL is a customizable GraphQL style query language for interacting with JavaScript objects (JSON). Use DinoQL to traverse JavaScript objects the same way you query APIs with GraphQL. DinoQL supports aliases, filters, fragments and other native GraphQL functionality."

</details>
<details><summary>Filler sentence examples</summary>

- "Learn more about additional features in the sample GraphiQL playgrounds available in the article."
- "If you know a tool that isn‚Äôt listed, feel free to contribute in the comments!"

</details>
<br />

_Choosing the right resource_ <br/>
It's important to consider the _[stack](https://mixpanel.com/topics/what-is-a-technology-stack/)_ of our audience in order to allow people with different levels of experience to enjoy the content.
Resources covering topics like Ruby, .NET, GraphQL vs. REST, and Vue.js generate lower interest since they're a dime a dozen on the internet.

<details><summary>Topic examples</summary>

- [Lee Byron](https://medium.com/@leeb/introducing-the-graphql-foundation-3235d8186d6d)
- [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/videos/2019/building-the-new-facebookcom-with-react-graphql-and-relay/)
- Big named services, like [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [Nexus](https://nexus.js.org/)
- [Best practices](https://code.kiwi.com/relay-and-graphql-best-practices-b09ce1d6d7ea)
- [List of tools](https://blog.bitsrc.io/13-graphql-tools-and-libraries-you-should-know-in-2019-e4b9005f6fc2)
- [Trends](https://nilan.netlify.com/posts/graphql-trends-in-2019/)
- _new_ Github [packages](https://github.com/ef-eng/graphql-query-rewriter) that are _unique_ ‚Äî Look for stars and a [well-documented README](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator)
- GraphQL [journey](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hIScta6OxQ8)

<br />
Before deciding on a resource, we can prevent any duplicates by checking the prior week's newsletter for repeating topics.

You can also check on [https://www.justgraphql.com/](https://www.justgraphql.com/) and click the resources tab to quickly search through GQLW's archive.
Make sure the resources are spread out in terms of beginner and advanced levels, and always look at the date posted!

## Tweet

_Format_ <br/>
[Emoji][title of article] [Twitter handle]

<details><summary>Tweet example</summary>

</details>
<br/>

_Character Count_ <br/>
The tweet needs to fit under _280 characters_.
An excellent way to test this is by going to Twitter and creating a fake tweet.
No need to post it; this provides a way to be accurate.

<details><summary>Fake tweet example</summary>

![](https://i.ibb.co/c8GV4vn/Screen-Shot-2019-05-03-at-5-42-46-PM.png)

The bottom right circle with the number lets us know how many characters are left.

</details>

<br />

If you go past the word count, we can shorten the description by omitting some of the topics. Check out [https://www.graphqlweekly.com/](https://www.graphqlweekly.com/) for the ordered list of resources posted.

<details><summary>Shortened tweet example</summary>

After

</details>

Either the number of resources or the titles itself can be shortened.

_Titles_ <br/>
Titles can change to fit our needs. Here are some examples:

> "Data Journey with Golang, GraphQL and Microservices - GopherCon SG 2019" can be shortened to "Data Journey with Golang, GraphQL and Microservices".

Github package titles are typically the name of the repo, not the package name.

> "GraphQL Query Rewriter" can be titled "graphql-query-rewriter"

Tutorials, articles, or videos that are a series, like a 1/3 part series, we can mention that in the title to preface the reader.

> "GraphQL Nexus Tutorial[1/5]: GraphQL Nexus Overview"`can be titled`"5 Part Series on GraphQL Nexus"

_Emojis_<br/>
You can pick any emojis you think are appropriate. If you can't find an emoji that relates to the title (like graphql-birdseye can have the ü¶Ö emoji), use any fun emoji!

_Twitter handles_ <br/>
The twitter handles can usually be found somewhere in the article, youtube description, or company websites. If it's a Github package, either use the company twitter handle or the personal one of the repo owner. Sometimes, it takes some digging around to find handles, but don't worry if you can't find it! You can always leave it blank, not everyone has a twitter account.
Also, make sure to double check the handle exists and is the correct person on Twitter.

_Footer_ <br/>
The footer is "and more in... graphqlweekly.com...". This part changes every week with the correct issue number. Double check that the [hyperlink](https://www.lifewire.com/how-do-hyperlinks-work-2483287) works:

If you try to erase just the end part of the link, the hyperlink doesn't update.

[graphqlweekly.com/issues/145](https://www.graphqlweekly.com/issues/145) vs. [graphqlweekly.com/issues/14](https://www.graphqlweekly.com/issues/145)6

The second link still directs you to issue 145, so that's something to look out for!

## Updating the official site

_Using gqlator_ <br/>
[WIP] - Github repo requires 2 factor auth and only Prisma can grant access

If needed, ask Kelsey
