> The Whills were a community of beings (from the Star Wars universe), who notably wrote the Journal of the Whills, a document that recorded important events in the galaxy, as well as philosophical reflections in verse. There were also shamans among them, one of which taught the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn that the ability to retain one's consciousness after death required absolute selflessness. The moon of Jedha was home to a Force-worshipping monastic order called the Guardians of the Whills. One of Jedha's most sacred places, the Temple of the Kyber, was also known as the "Temple of the Whills."

## Motivation

Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable—reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

- **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s self-contained**. Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **It’s reusable**. You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
- **It’s accessible**. Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.

# Contributing

## Working with the codebase

Before contributing to the whills, we need to establish a git protocol for
adding new content. Here are the steps:

1. Create a new branch (If you are working directly in GitHub, see section below).
1. Create a new pull request with the newly created branch (see section below if you are working directly with github)
1. As soon as the pull request is made, netlify will start to deploy a preview.
1. Send the url of the pull request to one of the lead devs and they will go review
   and merge the changes into the main site.

### Directly on GitHub

The quickest way to get started is to edit directly on GitHub. Here is a simple tutorial on
editing a file:

### Locally

1.  Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Novvum/whills.git
    ```
1.  Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
1.  To start the server, run:
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

## Content Structure

All of the content can be found in the `content` directory. The file Structure
is what determines what the links are in the navbar and sidebar.

This diagram shows how the mdx files map to the various UI elements.

## Sidebar Links

The name of the links in the sidebar are determined by the file/folder names.
We are doing a couple of things to convert the file/folder names to the ones we
see on the site:

- Numberings are automatically removed from the file name. For example,
  `1-General` is converted to "General". Numbering the files/folders lets us
  sort the content, but we wouldn't necessarily want to display them on the site.
- File names are automatically converted to Title Case. i.e. `employee-handbook`
  would be converted to "Employee Handbook".

### index.mdx files

The `index.mdx` files represent content for the folder containing it. For example,
the `content/guides/index.mdx` file is the home page for the guides section
(when you click the "Guides" link in the top navbar).

Each section header (i.e. "GENERAL") in the sidebar can also have a home
page by including an `index.mdx` file in the directory (i.e.
`content/guides/1-General/index.mdx`). If the index file exists, the
section header is clickable.

Sub-sections can also have folders with an index.mdx file to
represent the link (i.e. `content/guides/should-you-switch-tasks/index.mdx`).
