> The Whills were a community of beings (from the Star Wars universe), who notably wrote the Journal of the Whills, a document that recorded important events in the galaxy, as well as philosophical reflections in verse. There were also shamans among them, one of which taught the Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn that the ability to retain one's consciousness after death required absolute selflessness. The moon of Jedha was home to a Force-worshipping monastic order called the Guardians of the Whills. One of Jedha's most sacred places, the Temple of the Kyber, was also known as the "Temple of the Whills."

## Motivation

Design systems enable teams to build better products faster by making design reusable—reusability makes scale possible. This is the heart and primary value of design systems. A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

Regardless of the technologies and tools behind them, a successful design system follows these guiding principles:

- **It’s consistent**. The way components are built and managed follows a predictable pattern.
- **It’s self-contained**. Your design system is treated as a standalone dependency.
- **It’s reusable**. You’ve built components so they can be reused in many contexts.
- **It’s accessible**. Applications built with your design system are usable by as many people as possible, no matter how they access the web.
- **It’s robust**. No matter the product or platform to which your design system is applied, it should perform with grace and minimal bugs.

## Consistency

Your first, most important task when starting out is to define the rules
of your system, document them, and ensure that everyone follows them. When
you have clearly documented code standards and best practices in place,
designers and developers from across your organization are able to easily
use and, more importantly, contribute to your design system.

# Contributing

Before contributing to the whills, we need to establish a git protocol for
adding new content. Here are the steps:

1. Create a new branch (If you are working directly in GitHub, see section below).
1. Create a new pull request with the newly created branch (see section below if you are working directly with github)
1. As soon as the pull request is made, netlify will start to deploy a preview.
1. Send the url of the pull request to one of the lead devs and they will go review
   and merge the changes into the main site.

## Directly on GitHub

The quickest way to get started is to edit directly on GitHub. Here is a simple tutorial on
editing a file:
